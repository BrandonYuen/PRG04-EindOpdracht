# PRG04-EindOpdracht: My First Typescript Game
This is my first typescript/web game I've ever made. It's a player VS player tank game in which 2 people on the same computer/keyboard compete against eachother. The goal of the game is to simply blow eachother up by shooting and dodging bullets. Most of my time and effort has been put into quality aspects of the game like: rotated rectangle collision detection, smooth controls/movement of player objects and using actual game art assets.

The game does not have a name yet, any suggestions are always welcome.

## Requirements
- 2 Players on 1 computer/keyboard
- Chrome Browser (Haven't tested on other browsers, but they might also work)

## Controls
Player 1:
    - **Forward/Backward:** W/S
    - **Rotating:** A/D
    - **Shoot:** Spacebar

Player 2:
    - **Forward/Backward:** ↑/↓
    - **Rotating:** ←/→
    - **Shoot:** P

## Installation / How To Play
It's a web/typescript game, so all you need is a (chrome) browser.
You can **play the game** at [the github docs of this project](https://brandonyuen.github.io/PRG04-EindOpdracht/).
